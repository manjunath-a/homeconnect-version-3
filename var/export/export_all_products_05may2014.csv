One of the biggest hindrances in the treatment of Breast Cancer it&rsquo;s the late detection of its presence. When identified in time Breast Cancer can be successfully treated.</p>
<p>A lot of treatment centers in India depend on a surgeon&rsquo;s diagnosis to detect the presence of lumps in the breast. The patient is then recommended a Mammography to confirm the surgeon&rsquo;s suspicion. The two major drawbacks of this process are that sometimes the lumps have to be of a significant size before a surgeon can feel their presence and that Mammography is applicable only to women in their later years.</p>
<p>Breast Thermography offers younger women a sensitive, non-invasive examination that can detect Breast Cancer in its early stages. In this method an infrared scanning device is used to convert infrared radiation emitted from the skin surface into electrical impulses. These impulses are then converted into a color code depending on the intensity of the recorded temperature and then visualized in color on a monitor. <br /> This visual image graphically maps the body temperature, which is referred to as a thermogram. The spectrum of colors indicate an increase or decrease in the amount of infrared radiation being emitted from the body surface. Subtle abnormal temperature asymmetries can be easily identified and these asymmetries are indicative of disease processes.</p>
<p>Anjana Diagnostics is&nbsp; one of the first diagnostic centers in India to make use of the Infrared Digital Thermography or Breast Thermography for in-time detection of Breast Cancer.</p>
<p>Some of the advantages of availing of this diagnostic service are:</p>
<p>-&nbsp; The Thermograms are performed by a Technologist trained and certified by American College of Clinical Thermology; USA</p>
<p>-&nbsp; The Thermograms are evaluated by&nbsp; a trained Doctor with over 30 years of experience and certified by the American College of Clinical Thermology; USA</p>
<p>-&nbsp; It is painless and involves no radiation and can be used by patients as young as 20 years of age</p>
<p>-&nbsp; Patients can avail this technology to conduct regular breast check-ups in case of a genetic history of Breast Cancer</p>
<p><br /> <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Venue of the Center </span><br /> 531, 2nd Main, <br /> 2nd Stage, Indiranagar, <br /> [Behind B.D.A Complex] <br /> Bangalore &ndash; 560038</p>","<p>The threat of Breast Cancer is as real to men as it is to women. Even painless lumps can be dangerous. However when detected in time Breast Cancer can be successfully treated. &nbsp;Anjana Diagnostics is one of the first diagnostic centers in India to use the Infrared Digital Thermography or Breast Thermography equipment to identify Breast Cancer. This diagnostic imaging technology is non-invasive and helps visualize and quantify changes in breast surface temperature. This helps detect Breast Cancer even in its early stages.</p>
<p>Mammography has been the most reliable technology to detect a mass in the breast. But only women in their later years i.e. between the age group of 45 &ndash; 75 years can undergo this screening. The Infrared Digital Thermography can identify abnormalities in the breast almost 8-10 years before one qualifies for Mammography. This saves precious time in detecting the Breast Cancer and also enables the patient to seek the right treatment from an early stage.</p>","breast cancer, diagnosis, female, women, treatment, thermography, diagnostics","","[ USE DEFAULT ]","","","2014-04-15 00:00:00","","2014-03-10 00:00:00","2014-03-14 00:00:00","2014-03-24 00:00:00","","0.0000","0.0000","1","0","0","1","1.0000","1","0.0000","1","0","2014-05-14 11:36:16","","1","0","0","1","1","0.0000","1","0","0","1","1","Breast Thermography (For cancer diagnosis)","0","virtual","","","","","Bangalore","Infrared Digital Thermography ","","Diagnostics","No external radiation, no breast compression, no body contact Physiological changes in the tissues can be evaluated.

When the body has faced long periods of inactivity, Upayoga helps reinvigorate the body from within and prepares it for the main Kriya or activity. Upayoga has been thus named by the Rishi because of its <em>upa </em>or usefulness in de-stressing the body and awakening the energies within the body. The core focus of Upayoga is to strengthen the body from outside and within.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upayoga has been especially useful to frequent travelers who suffer from travel fatigues and jet lags. It has also proven very effective for children below 14 years of age who have a very sedentary life style. It is very strongly recommended for beginners who wish to pursue yoga on a regular basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upayoga when followed with Surya Kriya energizes the body and refreshes it. Surya Kriya is a powerful yogic practice designed as a holistic process for health, wellness and complete inner wellbeing. It activates the solar plexus within the system and balances your energies leading to stability of the body and calmness of the mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>-&nbsp; Develop mental clarity and focus</p>

<p>Upayoga and Surya Kriya is not just about exercising your body but strengthening it from within. It consists of a simple but powerful set of 10 practices that lubricate your joints, strengthen your muscles and awaken your inner energy. This set of practices which gets its inspiration from the ancient yogic asanas is aimed to strengthen your body and your mind and help you improve your inner well-being.<strong></strong></p>
<p>Some of the key advantages of Upayoga and Surya Kriya are:</p>

Apparently, you can with Quantum Speed Reading training! QSR focuses on mid-brain activation abilities. Discovered by accident by Yumiko Tobitani, a teacher of the Shichida Child Academy in Japan, QSR requires one to flip through the pages of the book without attempting to read any of the words.</p>
<p>Quantum Speed Reading works on a unique, scientifically proven concept. By nature, we use the left side of the brain for learning, reason and logic, albeit reading too is processed by the left side of the brain while the information gathered is then sent to the right side of the brain. However, QSR focuses on techniques that bypass the left part of the brain completely and tap directly in to the right part of the brain. Hence, the result is that we process information in a holistic, instant manner rather than a sequential, fragmented manner.</p>
<p>Some of the benefits of QSR include:</p>
<p>- Ability to read a book without actually reading every word</p>
<p>- Being able to read a book in any language, even one you don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>- Gaining more knowledge in a shorter span of time</p>
<p>- Improved ability to concentrate better on any given task</p>
<p>- Enhanced memory recollection ability</p>
<p>- Drastically improved personality</p>
<p>Our Quantum Speed Reading course uses time tested and proven techniques, like eye exercise, imaging exercise, listening to special music and meditation, to name just a few. This truly is a mid-stretching ability that results in a wealth of improvement in all spheres of life, be it professional, personal or spiritual.</p>

<p>Unlike the many well established forms of speed reading that are in existence, QSR does not require the book to stay open at all while you understand the content! The knowledge of Quantum Speed Reading can also be utilized in several other creative ways for:</p>
<p>- Problem solving</p>
<p>- Memorizing</p>
<p>- Health improvement</p>

</table>","Longing for smoother, straighter hair? Keratin hair-straightening treatments are a popular option at salons
If you usually style your hair straight, a keratin hair-straightening treatment could shorten your blow-dry time by 40% to 60%, says hair stylists
You shouldn't wash your hair for three or four days after getting the treatment. That's because the solution takes time to work
After you get a keratin hair treatment, and after the 'don't-wash' waiting period, you should use shampoo that are free from sodium-sulfate to help maintain the treatment
